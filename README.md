# 💧 Open Water Collector Project

A low-tech, open-source water collection structure designed for regions suffering from water scarcity — such as Chad, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Mediterranean areas. The system is suitable for local fabrication using bamboo, clay, and PVC materials.

> This is a theoretical project developed as part of an architectural design course. A scale model (1:10) is being constructed to demonstrate the concept.

## 🔍 What Is It?

A simple water collection unit made from a waterproof PVC-coated canvas structure mounted on a bamboo frame. Rainwater is funneled into a 1000L PVC tank through a bamboo pipe. The structure is lightweight, locally sourced, and easily replicable.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Bamboo frame** holds a tensile waterproof fabric
- **Rainwater** is collected and directed into the tank
- **Output valve** lets users access clean water
- **Mounted** on a standard wooden pallet
- **All joinery** done with rope knots or metal brackets

## 🚰 Why Chad?

Chad has one of the lowest access rates to safe water in Africa. Combined with refugee pressure and climate change, our proposal offers a small-scale, practical response to this ongoing crisis.
