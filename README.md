INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT

The current Project is about an Open-Source Design that examines a solution of a Water Collector Construction!
Below you will be able to find the technical drawings of our project in .pdf, .dwg and .3dm forms.
We also provide a list af theoritical materials and tools that you will need in order to create a 1/10 model of the design.

RESEARCH AND IDEA

The theoritical part of our project was to research an ongoing crisis ¨ARCHITECTURE IN THE AGE OF CRISIS¨ around the Mediterranean basin or in Sub-Saharan Africa.
After a small research, we decided to suggest a solution to the problem of lack of clean drinkable water in the area of Chad. 
The proposal of this open project can be created using topical materials such as wood, topical bamboo pieces grom the near tropical area, and clay in order to waterproof and protect materials for a longer lifespan.
