# 🌍 Water Collector – Open Design for Chad

A modular open-source water collector designed for the region of Chad, addressing the urgent issue of limited access to clean water. The design is replicable, low-cost, and adaptable to similar climates such as the Mediterranean south.

## 📌 Key Proposition

This project proposes a small-scale water collector that uses local and accessible materials (bamboo, clay, waterproof fabrics) to harvest and store rainwater. Its modularity and openness allow for adaptation to different regions facing water scarcity.

## 🛠️ Assembly Instructions

The full set of construction steps, connection details, and material layering instructions can be found in the [`scale-model/`](./scale-model/) folder, including mock-up building guidance for scale 1:10. Detailed diagrams and exploded views are provided.

## 🧾 Bill of Materials

- **Local bamboo poles** (Ø10cm, Ø3cm)
- **PVC-coated waterproof fabric**
- **1000L water tank (1x1x1m)** – imported
- **Metal L-joints**
- **Standard commercial plywood pallet**
- **Rope for lashing joints**
- **Clay (optional) for sealing/stabilization**
- [See full list with dimensions and specs in `design/BoM.pdf`](./design/)
